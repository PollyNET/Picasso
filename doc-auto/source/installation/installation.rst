Download and Installation
=========================

Picasso can be installed and used in Windows 10 and Linux (tested on `Centos 5`_). Since Picasso is developed in **Matlab (r2014a)**, it's required to have Matlab with compatible version installed in your machine.

Download
--------

Picasso project is hosted in `GitHub`_. The source code can be easily downloaded by running the command below, if `Git`_ was installed in your local machine.

.. note::

    Git is a very handy tool for code management and version control.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/PollyNET/Pollynet_Processing_Chain/

Dependencies
------------

Since `Picasso`_ is a very powerful lidar data processing platform, including data pre-processing, lidar calibration and data visualization, etc. It relies on many dependencies for realizing these features. Below are the list of Picasso **dependencies**:

- Python 3.6
- curl

It's recommended to use `Anaconda`_ for managing Python. Meanwhile, `matplotlib`_ is required for data visualization, but it's pre-installed in `Anaconda`_. And some additional Python packages are necessary for calculations and `Sphinx`_ docs. Below is the list of required Python packages:

SQLite is necessary for saving lidar calibration results. The `Java`_ connector has been provided in the folder of **./include**. But it needs to restart Matlab to activate this `Java`_ connector.
